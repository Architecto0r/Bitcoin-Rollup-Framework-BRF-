Bitcoin Rollup Framework: Whitepaper

1. Introduction
Bitcoin remains the most secure and decentralized cryptocurrency network, but it suffers from limited throughput and lacks native support for complex execution logic. This document presents a Rollup framework for Bitcoin, enabling off-chain transaction aggregation, virtual machine processing, and on-chain proof of correctness via Taproot scripts and fraud-proof mechanisms.

3. Motivation and Goals
The goal of the framework is to provide a scalable, trustless Layer 2 (L2) solution without modifying Bitcoin’s consensus rules. The solution aims to be:
 Compatible with existing Bitcoin nodes
 Secure in terms of fraud detection and conflict resolution
 Flexible and extensible: from simple payments to BitVM and RGB support

5. Architecture
Below is an architecture diagram that reflects the core components and their interactions:
[User Transactions]
↓
[Rollup Executor (VM)]
↓
[state_root, step_chain]
↓
[Taproot PSBT Generator] ←→ [Fraud Proof Handler]
↓
[Bitcoin TX → Taproot Output]
↓
[Watcher / CLI / Daemon]
↓
[PSBT challenge → On-chain dispute resolution]

3.1 Components
 Rollup Executor (off-chain VM): aggregates user transactions, computes state_root and step_chain
 Taproot PSBT Generator: builds addresses and scripts with multi-branch logic
 Fraud Proof Handler: processes disputes and generates PSBT challenges
 BitVM Script Tree (optional): script tree with step-by-step proof support

3.2 Data Flow
Simplified flow in pseudocode:
input: user_transactions[]
block = VM.aggregate(user_transactions)
state_root = VM.compute_state_root(block)
step_chain = VM.generate_step_chain(block)
taproot_tree = Taproot.compile(step_chain, fraud_paths)
address = taproot_tree.generate_address()
bitcoin_tx = Bitcoin.publish(address, commitment=state_root)
if Watcher.detects_fraud(bitcoin_tx):
fraud_proof = FraudHandler.generate_psbt(bitcoin_tx)
broadcast(fraud_proof)
The real process is orchestrated by a CLI utility and background daemons integrated with HWI and logging.

4. Rollup Block Format
{
"txs": [...],
"state_root": "...",
"step_chain": ["step1_hash", "step2_hash", ...],
"timestamp": 1680000000,
"signer": "..."
}

5. Verification and Proofs
5.1 Fraud-path
Each Taproot script may include a branch with OP_SHA256 step == expected, OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY timeout, and OP_RETURN log to confirm step validity. If verification fails — the fraud proof is accepted and the challenger wins.
Example pseudocode for step verification:
for i, step in enumerate(step_chain):
expected_hash = expected_steps[i]
computed = sha256(step.input_data)
if computed != expected_hash:
return FraudDetected(step_index=i, actual=computed, expected=expected_hash)
return NoFraud()
This logic can be implemented as OP_SHA256 + OP_EQUAL inside Taproot branches and validated through PSBT.

5.2 PSBT and Signing
The PSBT format is used with HWI support to allow hardware signing of challenge transactions without exposing private keys.

6. Security
 All transactions are protected by a fraud-proof mechanism: dishonest operators can be challenged.
 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY ensures enforced resolution deadlines.
 Timeouts: if a challenger fails to complete a step — they lose.
Timeout logic table:
Step
Timeout (blocks)
Condition
Action on Expiry
Provider response
10
No response to step
Challenger wins
Challenger response
10
No next hash provided
Prover wins
Final step
5
Dispute unresolved
Challenger loses
This logic is embedded in Taproot scripts via OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.

7. CLI and Automation
The fraud_cli.py provides:
 Block validation
 PSBT challenge generation
 HWI signing
 Auto-broadcasting
 JSON reports
 Watcher daemon with logging to fraud_daemon.log

9. Extensions and Modularity
 BitVM-compatible SHA256 step-chain in Taproot branches
 RGB integration
 state_root commitment via OP_RETURN or Taproot
 Penalty mechanisms and provable exits
